# dungeonsAndDragons
This app is for now meant to help users make their own D&D characters. 
There are also other things I'd like to implement in this app, like sharing characters with a DM where they can use this in an encounter for example.
I know that there are tons of apps that already do this, but this is more of an excercise for me than to make an actual application that i would want to sell.
